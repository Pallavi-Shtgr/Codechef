Two teams 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B played several games against each other and finally ended up with the score of 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y points respectively.
We do not know how many games were played. Find the minimum possible number of draws that may have happened.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one way to end up with the final score being 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y points respectively.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y - the final scores of teams 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of draws that could have happened.
