// Card Game
// There is a set of N cards where each card is numbered 
// 1 to N.

// Chef throws a card numbered X.
// Find the number of ways, Chefina can chose a card from the remaining deck such that, the sum of chosen card and X is even.
  
// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
// Each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and X â€” the number of cards and the card thrown by Chef.
  
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line, the number of ways, Chefina can chose a card from the remaining deck such that, the sum of chosen card and 
// X
// X is even.
