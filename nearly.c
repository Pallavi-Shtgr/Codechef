// Nearly Equal
// The Hamming distance between two pairs of strings of equal length is defined to be the number of positions at which they contain different characters.
// For example, the Hamming distance between strings "there" and "shire" is 
// 2 (their first and third characters are different), while the Hamming distance between "order"and  "chaos" is 5, since they differ at every position.
// Chef has a string A of length N.
// Chef's favorite string is B, which has length M. It is known that Mâ‰¤N.
// Find the minimum Hamming distance between B and some contiguous substring of A that has length M.
