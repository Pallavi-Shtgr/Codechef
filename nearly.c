// Nearly Equal
// The Hamming distance between two pairs of strings of equal length is defined to be the number of positions at which they contain different characters.
// For example, the Hamming distance between strings 
// "there"
// "there" and 
// "shire"
// "shire" is 
// 2
// 2 (their first and third characters are different), while the Hamming distance between 
// "order"
// "order" and 
// "chaos"
// "chaos" is 
// 5
// 5, since they differ at every position.

// Chef has a string 
// 𝐴
// A of length 
// 𝑁
// N.
// Chef's favorite string is 
// 𝐵
// B, which has length 
// 𝑀
// M. It is known that 
// 𝑀
// ≤
// 𝑁
// M≤N.

// Find the minimum Hamming distance between 
// 𝐵
// B and some contiguous substring
// †
// †
//   of 
// 𝐴
// A that has length 
// 𝑀
// M.
