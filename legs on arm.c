// Legs on a Farm
// After a long and fulfilling career, Chef has decided to retire to a farm out in the countryside.
// This farm has several cows and chickens, but Chef doesn't know exactly how many of each there are â€” he can only see that there are N legs in total across all the animals.
// Note that each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs, and it is guaranteed that N is even.With N legs in total, what's the minimum possible number of animals that can be present on the farm?
