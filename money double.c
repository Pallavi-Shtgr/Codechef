// Money Double
// Chef's bank gives him a unique offer â€” at the end of each year, they offer Chef to either add 1000 rupees to his bank account, or double the amount stored in his bank account.
// Chef initially has X rupees in his account. What is the maximum amount of money that Chef can accumulate after Y years?
// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
// The first and only line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers X and Y, as described in the statement.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line one integer: the maximum amount of money which Chef can accumulate after Y years.
